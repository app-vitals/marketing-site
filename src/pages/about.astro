  <!-- Our Story -->
  <section class="border-y border-white/10 bg-navy-800/20">

      <div class="max-w-3xl">
        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-8">Our story</h2>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          <p>
            We've spent 40+ combined years building and leading engineering teams at companies like Uber and Alto Pharmacy. We've navigated bureaucracy, shipped distributed systems for millions of users, and learned what it takes to move fast at scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we're applying that experience to the biggest shift in software engineering since the cloud: AI-assisted development. Most teams know they should be using AI tools. Few know how to adopt them without creating a mess.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's the gap we fill. We don't roll out tools and hope for the best. We find the engineers who are already excited, coach them into champions, and help them spread adoption organically across the team. Same bar for AI code as human code. No shortcuts.

  <!-- Philosophy -->

      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-12 text-center">Our approach</h2>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-electric-500">Champions, not mandates</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            Top-down AI mandates get ignored. We find the engineers who are already excited and help them become the proof that adoption works. Their peers follow because they see results — not because they were told to.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-electric-500">Context is infrastructure</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            AI tools are only as useful as the context they have. We build the foundation — architecture docs, shared patterns, conventions — that makes AI genuinely understand your codebase.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-electric-500">Ship first, strategize second</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            We deliver production code in Week 1, not PowerPoints. Strategy comes from doing the work and seeing what actually moves the needle for your team.

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-electric-500">Two founders + AI</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            We're a small team by design. Two senior engineers leveraging AI tools means startup velocity with enterprise quality. No overhead, no layers, no diluted expertise.
